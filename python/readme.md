# thrust

thrust is the Python binding to the Rust version of the [traffic](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic) library. The name is a pun based on traffic and Rust, which relates well to the aviation world.

In practice, thrust has not been designed to be used as is: it is supposed to be a dependency for the Python traffic library, and is imported for optimized sections of the code.

Python version of traffic: https://github.com/xoolive/traffic

Rust version of traffic: https://github.com/xoolive/traffic-rs
